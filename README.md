# Development-Portfolio
A Portfolio of my personal web development projects
This site features a couple of techniques that I recently learned to use.  The entire site is coded using only HTML and CSS.

Featured techniques:\n
-Used Absolute/Relative positioning to overlay text and images onto images
-Extensive use of Flexbox to make the site more responsive
-Creative use of anchor tags to make icons and images double as links
-New use of anchor tags (for me) to have icons prompt users to send emails or make a phone call or text message
