            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am an avid learner always looking to improve myself and develop another skill. I view learning as a 
                lifelong passion.  I've had experience on several different projects within the Automotive manufacturing 
                industry.  On each project I've pushed to learn and develop new skills.  I've picked up proficiency with 
                Microsoft Office applications, especially Excel and Access, and have gained exposure to other industry tools
                including MODAPTs, AutoCAD, Six Sigma, and MODAPTs analysis. I've also spent a fair amount of time
                developing customer service and guest relation skills at Olive Garden.  Over my four year tenure at the 
                restaurant I trained in every position and handled responsibilities including floor management, on-site 
                training, guest recovery, inventory management, and total quality assurance.</p>
